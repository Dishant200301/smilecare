    title: "A Shocking New Way to Treat Infections",
    excerpt: "New research introduces a revolutionary treatment for these infections. The group is utilizing advanced methods to combat resistance.",
    content: [
      "Titanium has many properties that make it a great choice for use in implants. Its low density, high stiffness, high biomechanical strength-to-weight ratio, and corrosion resistance have led to its use in several types of implants, from dental to joints. However, a persistent problem plagues metal-based implants: the surface is also a perfect home for microbes to accumulate, causing chronic infections and inflammation in the surrounding tissue. Consequently, five to 10 percent of dental implants fail and must be removed within 10-15 years to prevent infection in the blood and other organs.",
      "New research from the University of Pittsburgh's Swanson School of Engineering introduces a revolutionary treatment for these infections. The group, led by Tagbo Niepa, PhD, is utilizing electrochemical therapy (ECT) to enhance the ability of antibiotics to eradicate the microbes.",
      "\"We live in a crisis with antibiotics: most of them are failing. Because of the drug-resistance that most microbes develop, antimicrobials stop working, especially with recurring infections,\" says Dr. Niepa, author on the paper and assistant professor of chemical and petroleum engineering at the Swanson School, with secondary appointments in civil and environmental engineering and bioengineering.",
      "\"It's more likely that antibiotics will be more effective if the cells are simultaneously challenged by the permeabilizing effects of the currents. This would allow even drug-resistant cells to become susceptible to treatment and be eradicated.\"",
      "The novel method passes a weak electrical current through the metal-based implant, damaging the attached microbe's cell membrane but not harming the surrounding healthy tissue. This damage increases permeability, making the microbe more susceptible to antibiotics. Since most antibiotics specifically work on cells that are going to replicate, they do not work on dormant microbes, which is how infections can recur. The ECT causes electrochemical stress in all the cells to sensitize them, making them more susceptible to antibiotics.",
      "The researchers hope this technology will change how infections are treated. Researchers focused their research on Candida albicans (C. albicans), one of the most common and harmful fungal infections associated with dental implants. But while dental implants are one exciting application for this new technology, Niepa says it has other potential applications, such as in wound dressings."

    excerpt: "Brushing teeth frequently is linked with lower risks of atrial fibrillation and heart failure, according to a new study published recently.",
    content: [
      "Brushing your teeth isn't just about maintaining a bright smile and fresh breath; it could also be a key factor in protecting your heart health. A recent study published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology suggests a strong link between oral hygiene and cardiovascular health.",
      "The research, which involved over 160,000 participants with no history of atrial fibrillation or heart failure, found that those who brushed their teeth three or more times a day had a 10% lower risk of atrial fibrillation and a 12% lower risk of heart failure compared to those who brushed less frequently.",
      "The connection lies in the inflammation caused by poor oral hygiene. Bacteria in the mouth can enter the bloodstream and cause inflammation in the blood vessels, which can lead to heart problems. By maintaining good oral hygiene, you reduce the bacterial load and the subsequent risk of inflammation."

      "Like tree rings, teeth grow in layers, and each layer captures chemical signatures from the body at the time of its formation. This allows scientists to reconstruct a timeline of an individual's life, identifying periods of stress, illness, and dietary changes.",

    excerpt: "The use of opioids to soothe the pain of a pulled tooth could be drastically reduced or eliminated with better alternatives.",
    content: [
      "For years, opioids have been the go-to prescription for pain management after tooth extractions. However, new studies suggest that non-opioid alternatives, such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen, are just as effective, if not more so, with fewer side effects.",
      "The study found that patients who took a combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen reported better pain relief and fewer adverse effects than those who took opioids. Additionally, avoiding opioids reduces the risk of addiction and misuse.",
      "Dentists are now being encouraged to prescribe non-opioid pain relievers as the first line of defense against post-extraction pain."
