    title: "A Shocking New Way to Treat Infections",
    excerpt: "New research introduces a revolutionary treatment for these infections. The group is utilizing advanced methods to combat resistance.",
    content: [
      "Titanium has many properties that make it a great choice for use in implants. Its low density, high stiffness, high biomechanical strength-to-weight ratio, and corrosion resistance have led to its use in several types of implants, from dental to joints. However, a persistent problem plagues metal-based implants: the surface is also a perfect home for microbes to accumulate, causing chronic infections and inflammation in the surrounding tissue. Consequently, five to 10 percent of dental implants fail and must be removed within 10-15 years to prevent infection in the blood and other organs.",
      "New research from the University of Pittsburgh's Swanson School of Engineering introduces a revolutionary treatment for these infections. The group, led by Tagbo Niepa, PhD, is utilizing electrochemical therapy (ECT) to enhance the ability of antibiotics to eradicate the microbes.",
      "\"We live in a crisis with antibiotics: most of them are failing. Because of the drug-resistance that most microbes develop, antimicrobials stop working, especially with recurring infections,\" says Dr. Niepa, author on the paper and assistant professor of chemical and petroleum engineering at the Swanson School, with secondary appointments in civil and environmental engineering and bioengineering.",
      "\"It's more likely that antibiotics will be more effective if the cells are simultaneously challenged by the permeabilizing effects of the currents. This would allow even drug-resistant cells to become susceptible to treatment and be eradicated.\"",
      "The novel method passes a weak electrical current through the metal-based implant, damaging the attached microbe's cell membrane but not harming the surrounding healthy tissue. This damage increases permeability, making the microbe more susceptible to antibiotics. Since most antibiotics specifically work on cells that are going to replicate, they do not work on dormant microbes, which is how infections can recur. The ECT causes electrochemical stress in all the cells to sensitize them, making them more susceptible to antibiotics.",
      "The researchers hope this technology will change how infections are treated. Researchers focused their research on Candida albicans (C. albicans), one of the most common and harmful fungal infections associated with dental implants. But while dental implants are one exciting application for this new technology, Niepa says it has other potential applications, such as in wound dressings.",
      "Regular dental check-ups are essential for maintaining good oral health. These visits allow your dentist to detect and treat problems early, before they become more serious and expensive to fix.",
      "In addition to brushing and flossing, using a mouthwash can help reduce plaque and freshen breath. Look for a mouthwash that contains fluoride to help strengthen tooth enamel. A healthy diet is also important for oral health. Sugary foods and drinks can contribute to tooth decay, so it's best to limit them. Sticky foods can also damage teeth.",

    excerpt: "Brushing teeth frequently is linked with lower risks of atrial fibrillation and heart failure, according to a new study published recently.",
    content: [
      "Brushing your teeth isn't just about maintaining a bright smile and fresh breath; it could also be a key factor in protecting your heart health. A recent study published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology suggests a strong link between oral hygiene and cardiovascular health. The study indicates that the simple act of brushing your teeth regularly could have a profound impact on your overall well-being.",
      "The research, which involved over 160,000 participants with no history of atrial fibrillation or heart failure, found that those who brushed their teeth three or more times a day had a 10% lower risk of atrial fibrillation and a 12% lower risk of heart failure compared to those who brushed less frequently. This correlation highlights the importance of oral hygiene as a potential preventative measure against serious heart conditions.",
      "The connection lies in the inflammation caused by poor oral hygiene. Bacteria in the mouth can enter the bloodstream and cause inflammation in the blood vessels, which can lead to heart problems. By maintaining good oral hygiene, you reduce the bacterial load and the subsequent risk of systemic inflammation that can damage the cardiovascular system.",
      "Researchers believe that the bacteria commonly found in the oral cavity, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, can travel through the bloodstream and attach to the fatty deposits in the heart's blood vessels. This can contribute to the formation of clots and lead to heart attacks or strokes.",
      "Understanding the connection between oral health and heart health is crucial for adopting a holistic approach to wellness. It shifts the perspective of dental care from being solely cosmetic or localized to being a vital part of systemic health maintenance.",
      "Treatment for those with existing heart conditions should always include a dental evaluation. Addressing gum disease and other oral infections can be a significant step in managing overall cardiovascular risk.",
      "Prevention starts with a robust daily routine. To protect both your smile and your heart, consider incorporating these habits:",

      "Teeth are more than just tools for eating; they are biological archives that record the history of an individual's life. New research has shown that teeth can reveal information about a person's diet, health, and even the environment they lived in. Each layer of enamel acts as a time capsule, preserving chemical markers from specific periods of development.",
      "Like tree rings, teeth grow in layers, and each layer captures chemical signatures from the body at the time of its formation. This allows scientists to reconstruct a timeline of an individual's life, identifying periods of stress, illness, and dietary changes. By analyzing isotopes and trace elements, researchers can determine where a person lived and what they ate at different ages.",
      "This research has profound implications for archaeology and forensic science, providing a new way to understand the lives of ancient populations and identify unknown remains. It allows for a level of biographical detail that was previously impossible to obtain from skeletal remains alone.",
      "One key insight is the ability to detect physiological stress events, such as famine or severe illness. These events leave permanent disruptions in the enamel formation, known as hypoplasia, which can be dated with remarkable precision.",

    excerpt: "The use of opioids to soothe the pain of a pulled tooth could be drastically reduced or eliminated with better alternatives.",
    content: [
      "For years, opioids have been the go-to prescription for pain management after tooth extractions. However, new studies suggest that non-opioid alternatives, such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen, are just as effective, if not more so, with fewer side effects. This shift challenges long-standing dental practices and prioritizes patient safety in the midst of an opioid crisis.",
      "The study found that patients who took a combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen reported better pain relief and fewer adverse effects than those who took opioids. Additionally, avoiding opioids reduces the risk of addiction and misuse. This finding is critical for reducing the number of leftover opioid pills that can find their way into the wrong hands.",
      "Dentists are now being encouraged to prescribe non-opioid pain relievers as the first line of defense against post-extraction pain. This simple change in prescribing habits can have a significant impact on public health without compromising patient comfort.",

    excerpt: "When a person has a cavity in their tooth, a dentist will probably recommend a filling. Fillings are safe and effective.",
    content: [
      "It's not uncommon to experience some sensitivity or pain after getting a tooth filling. This can be caused by several factors, including the depth of the cavity, the type of material used, or inflammation of the pulp. While usually temporary, understanding the cause can help you manage the discomfort effectively.",
      "Usually, this sensitivity subsides within a few days or weeks. However, if the pain persists or worsens, it could indicate a problem with the filling or the tooth itself, such as an infection or a crack. The nerve inside the tooth may be irritated by the drilling or the filling material itself.",
      "If you experience persistent pain after a filling, it's important to return to your dentist for an evaluation. Ignoring the pain can lead to more serious complications, such as the need for a root canal or even tooth extraction.",
      "Another potential cause is an incorrect bite. If the filling is slightly too high, it can cause pain when you bite down. This is easily corrected by a dentist adjusting the filling.",
      "Understanding that some post-procedure sensitivity is normal can reduce anxiety. However, being aware of the signs of complications ensures you seek timely care when necessary.",
      "Treatment for post-filling pain depends on the cause. It may range from simple bite adjustments to desensitizing agents, or in rare cases, replacing the filling.",

      "A dental bridge is a common solution for replacing missing teeth. It consists of one or more artificial teeth (pontics) held in place by dental crowns on the adjacent natural teeth (abutments). This restorative procedure restores both the function and aesthetics of your smile.",
      "Bridges can restore your smile, improve your ability to chew and speak, and prevent your remaining teeth from shifting out of position. There are several types of bridges available, including traditional, cantilever, and Maryland bridges. Each type serves a specific purpose depending on the location of the missing tooth and the health of the surrounding teeth.",
      "Your dentist can help you determine if a dental bridge is the right option for you. Factors such as the number of missing teeth, the condition of the abutment teeth, and your gum health will all play a role in the decision-making process.",
      "The longevity of a bridge largely depends on the health of the supporting teeth. If the anchor teeth decay or the gums become diseased, the bridge can fail. Therefore, hygiene is paramount.",
      "Understanding the structure of a bridge helps in maintaining it. Knowing that it is a connected unit means you must use special cleaning aids to reach underneath the pontic.",

      "Antibiotics are often prescribed to treat tooth infections, but they are not always necessary. In many cases, the infection can be treated by draining the abscess or performing a root canal. The overuse of antibiotics is a global health concern, and dentistry plays a role in stewardship.",
      "Antibiotics are typically reserved for severe infections that have spread to other parts of the body or for patients with weakened immune systems. Overuse of antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance, so it's important to use them only when necessary and as prescribed by a healthcare professional.",
